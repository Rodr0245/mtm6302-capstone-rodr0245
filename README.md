### Design Decisions for my Pokémon Pokédex Web Application

#### Overview

The primary goal of this Pokémon Pokédex web application is to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface where they can easily search for Pokémon, add them to their "caught" list, and view detailed information about each Pokémon. This includes their biography, moves, type, images, and etc. The design decisions were made based on some research I made on current online Pokedexes as well as real in-game pokedexes. I have also made sure to focus on enhancing user experience.

#### Initial User Interaction

- **Search Bar Placement**: The first element users encounter upon loading the application is a prominently placed search bar. This decision stems from the observation that most users visit Pokédex websites to find information on specific Pokémon. By making the search bar the focal point of the landing page, users can immediately start their search without any confusion or unnecessary navigation. This approach addresses a common frustration where search bars are hidden or hard to find, ensuring a seamless user experience right from the start.

#### Design Approach

- **Mobile-First Design**: The design process began with a mobile-first approach. This ensures that the application is fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on smaller screens before scaling up to larger tablet and desktop views. In today’s mobile-centric world, it’s crucial that applications are optimized for mobile use, which often results in a cleaner and more efficient design even on larger screens.

#### Visual Aesthetics

- **Color Scheme**: The application features a colorful yet minimalistic design. Each Pokémon type is represented by a specific color palette that aligns with its type characteristics. For example, electric-type Pokémon pages feature yellowish backgrounds, enhancing the thematic experience. The chosen colors are pastel shades, which provide a subtle and harmonious look. This decision ensures that the application remains vibrant and engaging without overwhelming the user, adhering to a minimalistic aesthetic.

- **Navigation**: A conscious decision was made to eliminate a traditional navigation bar. Given the simplicity of the application’s functionality, a navigation bar was deemed unnecessary. Users land on the homepage with the search bar, search for a Pokémon, view its details, and can easily return to the homepage by clicking the back arrow on the top left. This straightforward navigation reduces clutter and enhances the user experience by focusing on core interactions.

#### Typography

- **Font Choice - SF Pro Display**: The typeface “SF Pro Display” was chosen for its roundish appearance and readability. This font is known for its clean and modern look, which complements the minimalistic design of the application. It is particularly well-suited for my Pokémon Pokédex web application due to its legibility on various screen sizes and its aesthetic alignment with the playful yet professional feel of Pokémon branding. The font enhances the overall user experience by providing clear and easy-to-read text, which is crucial for displaying detailed Pokémon information.

#### Conclusion

The design decisions for this Pokémon Pokédex web application were made with a strong focus on user experience, ease of use, and aesthetic appeal. By prioritizing a prominent search bar, adopting a mobile-first approach, utilizing a pastel color scheme tied to Pokémon types, simplifying navigation, and selecting a readable and visually appealing typeface, the application aims to provide a delightful and efficient tool for all Pokémon fans such as myself.
